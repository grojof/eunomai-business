# Changelog

## 0.1.0 · 2026-10-24

First development version.

- **Plugin and local connector** for Claude Cowork, built per organization with `tools/build.py`.
- **Sign-in** with OAuth 2.0 public clients (git server, Entra ID); tokens encrypted per user.
- **Workspaces, versions, save points and pull requests** without Git installed (`workspace_*`, `version_*`).
- **Barriers** enforced in code: main branch protected, token only to the git server, HTTPS only, git hooks and
  unexpected `.git/config` entries disabled, the computer's git configuration ignored.
- **Diagnostics** (`diag_*`, validation skills, hook log) only in builds that enable them.
- **Tests** against a fake git server; **docs** for IT, security and repository owners; design decisions.
